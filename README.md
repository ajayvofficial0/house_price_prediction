README: Predicting House Prices in Bangalore using Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge Regression

Introduction:
This project aims to predict house prices in Bangalore utilizing three different regression techniques: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression. We will leverage Keras and TensorFlow to implement these algorithms and train our models. The dataset used for training and testing is the Bangalore Housing Dataset, which contains various features related to houses in Bangalore along with their corresponding prices.


Usage:
1. Preprocess the data: Before training the models, preprocess to filter out the dataset to handle missing values, scale the features, and split the data into training and testing sets.
   
2. Train and evaluate the models:
   - For Linear Regression.
   - For Lasso Regression.
   - For Ridge Regression.

Results:
After running the models, compare the performance metrics (such as Mean Squared Error, R-squared score) for each model on the test dataset.
